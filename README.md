## For You Developer

<p style="font-size: 1.4rem">⚠️ Game Logic Focus:</p>

While the application is fully functional with various JavaScript features, it's important to note that the styling is kept simple, and no separate files were created for styling or logic architecture.

- **No Dependencies:** The game is designed to be straightforward, and no external dependencies were installed for this project.

- **Styling Approach:** The game uses Internal styles for simplicity, ensuring that the focus remains on gameplay mechanics.

These aspects are noted because <span style="font-weight: bold">In future updates, there may be opportunities to enhance the styling and organization, but for now, the current implementation effectively supports the game’s core functionality.</span>
